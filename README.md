Mighty
======
[Zend Framework][1] is great, that's why I've used parts of it in Mighty.
However, Zend Framework is becoming increasingly heavy weight, and frankly turning into a framework only a J2EE coder could love.

For smaller projects I've created Mighty. Far simpler but still provides structure for you to build your web application.

I extracted this framework from a [small web site][2] I had to build recently. At present Mighty uses [Zend Layout][3], 
[Zend View][4] and [Zend Session][5].
